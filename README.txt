EMd360 v1603 (2016-07-19) by Bobby Curtis

EMd360 is a "free to use" tool to perform an in-depth investigation of an Oracle Enterprise 
Manager environment. It collects detailed information around the Oracle Management Server (OMS)
and Oracle Management Repository (OMR). It also helps to document any findings.
EMd360 installs nothing and is completely SQL based against the OMS. Expectation is that
EMd360 should be executed as SYS on the OMR.  It takes a few minutes to execute. Output 
ZIP file can be large (several MBs), so you may want to execute EMd360 from a 
system directory with at least 1 GB of free space. 

Steps
~~~~~
1. Unzip EMd360.zip, navigate to the root EMd360 directory, and connect as SYS, 
   DBA, or any User with Data Dictionary access:

   $ unzip EMd360.zip
   $ cd EMd360
   $ sqlplus <dba_user>/<dba_pwd>

2. Execute EMd360.sql indicating two input parameters. The first one is to specify 
   the OMS name. The second one is to specify the OMR database SID. Example below specifies 
   the OMS of "pebble" and the OMR of "emrep". EMd360 uses 31 days by default. 

   SQL> @emd360.sql pebble emrep 
   
3. Unzip output sqld360_<omr name>_<oms host>_YYYYMMDD_HH24MI.zip into a directory on your PC

4. Review main html file 0001_emd360_<omr name>_index.html
